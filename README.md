# PROG 01: Crunch Time

Crunch Time is an application designed for the average person curious about how many calories they are burning whenever they exercise. It allows the user to input how much exercise they have done and see the corresponding number of calories burned. In addition, it also displays the equivalent number of reps or minutes needed to burn the same number of calories for all the other exercises.
